      question: "What Services do Hair Salons Provide?",
      answer:
        "The leading service that hair salons offer is haircuts for women, men, and children . Their haircuts and styles go beyond the basics that you'd find at a barbershop. The stylists at a hair salon can provide stylish cuts that you'd find in a fashion magazine. They can also shampoo, condition, and dry your hair. Some salons offer manicures and will sell products such as hairspray and styling gel. When you use Salon, you can instantly view each salon's main services.",

      question: "How do You Prepare for a Hair Salon Appointment?",
      answer:
        "When visiting a salon, it's a wise idea not to wash your hair beforehand. Most haircuts will begin with a shampoo session, so you'll save yourself some shampoo at home. Also, it's a good idea to carry cash with you to tip your stylist and their assistants. Finally, use Salon to schedule your appointment in advance. That way, you guarantee yourself a spot with the provider of your choosing. You also won't have to worry about walking in at a busy time with a long wait.",
